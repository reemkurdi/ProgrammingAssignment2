## Write a short comment describing this function

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## cacheSolve computes inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        ## Checks whether the inverse has already been calculated or not 
        ## If it has, and matrix has not changed then cacheSolve retrieves
        ## inverse from the cache
}
